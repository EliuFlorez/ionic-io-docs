Ionic Creator
-----

The Ionic Creator is a drag-and-drop tool that makes it easy to rapidly design
and export Ionic app prototypes. One great feature of the tool is that it
exports clean and ready-to-go Ionic code.

Ionic Creator is not meant to be a replacement for coding, so we've intentionally kept 
the tool simple. You can create new Ionic pages from a template or blank page,
drag-and-drop many of the core Ionic components, save to and load from the cloud, and export 
working Ionic code.

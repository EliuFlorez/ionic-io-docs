Ionic Analytics

*Note: make sure to follow the [Getting Started])(/docs/services/getting-started) guide to install the core platform client libraries
before following this guide.*

The Ionic Analytics service makes it easy to add powerful analytics to your hybrid mobile apps.

Unlike other analytics providers, Ionic can infer user behavior through the deep
integration of the analytics system with the UI layer. This means Ionic can automatically
track taps and interactions, and also associate events with varios states in your app's routing (to generate heatmaps, for example).

### Using Ionic Analytics

We start by adding the analytics service client code:

```bash
$ ionic add ionic-service-analytics
```

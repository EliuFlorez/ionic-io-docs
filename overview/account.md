Your Ionic Account
------

Things might be getting confusing with all the Ionic releases out there. With the framework, our client tools like [Ionic Box](http://github.com/driftyco/ionic-box) and [ngCordova](http://ngCordova.com/), our web tools like [Creator](http://creator.ionic.io/), and now our platform services at [Ionic.io](http://ionic.io/), you might be wondering how your ionic.io account fits into the Ionic ecosystem.

### "The Frontend is Free"

The rule of thumb when it comes to Ionic projects is that if they run on the client-side, they are most likely free to use, both in cost
and usually in license.

Ionic services that run on our server infrastructure are paid services and are largely closed-source. Backend services
require user authentication and rely on your ionic.io user account.

So in general, if you download and use an ionic client-side library or tool, you won't need to log in to use it unless
it integrates with an ionic.io service.
